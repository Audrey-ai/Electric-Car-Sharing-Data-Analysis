# Electric-Car-Sharing-Data-Analysis
This project is aimed at solving a research question for an electric car-sharing company by processing stations data to understand electric car usage over time.

#### By AUDREY IMALI

## Description
This project is based on an electric car-sharing service company and the aim is to process stations data to understand electric car usage over time and solve a reserch question of identifying the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018.
The dataset for this project contains data collected for a period of 9 days and we also have a complete description of the data in a separate document for easier understanding of the dataset.

Basically to best answer the research question the project phases would involve Business understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Analysis, Evaluation and Recommendation.Going through these phases would best assist the company not ony answer the reserach question but also find out other interesting insights from the dataset such as; Finding the most popular station overall and at the most picking hour, Finding the most popular hour for returning cars and most importantly Finding out if the results changed when Utilib and Utilib 1.4 are used instead of Blue cars. Through this research the most vulnerable areas of the business can also be detected all aimed at compelling the Company to shift to greater heights.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
All you need to run this code is a browser with access to Google CoLab or alternatively Jupyter Notebook can be used.Both tools are for data preparation and analysis.
For data manipulation the Numpy and Pandas libraries should be imported.
